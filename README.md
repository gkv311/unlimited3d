Unlimited3d - articles' archive
===============================

This repository represents an archive of articles:<br/>
https://blog.sview.ru

The contents of this repository could be generated into static HTML website by Jekyll generator.

The articles are stored within `_posts` folder (followed Jekyll conventions) in the way, that they could be also rendered nicely by a MarkDown viewer directly within web interface for `git` repository.
For that reason, each article is placed into a dedicated subfolder `YYYY-mm-dd-NAME` with `readme.md` file (the article itself) and `_images` subfolder containing images related to the article.

`.tags` file contains the list of predefined 'tags' for generation `/tags/tag1.md ... /tags/tagN.md` pages by a bash script.
