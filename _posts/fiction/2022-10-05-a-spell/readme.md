Kind of off-topic to my blog, but nevertheless – just a short verse of my own.

✦ ✦ ✦

*You have a spell,*

*Which works on me.*

*A simple smile*

*That feels warm to me.*

<!--break-->
<br>

*You enter room,*

*Like the sunrise shining.*

*One look at me,*

*And my heartbeat's rising.*

<br>

*Your angel's eyes*

*Look right through me.*

*They see my smiles,*

*But not the soul in me.*

<br>

*Just simple call*

*Would let my sorrow flee.*

*That simple spell,*

*Will you cast on me?*
