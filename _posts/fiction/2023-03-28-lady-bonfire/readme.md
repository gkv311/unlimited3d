This was a cold Saturday in late autumn. Heavy gloomy clouds promised to rain. Grey sky was already darkening, though night was still to come.
He looked at a watch to check the time left for the event, focused on his thoughts –
*"Team building, heh! Why am I going there anyway? Too many people, the same old faces, drinking, smiling, chatting... It all makes no sense"*.

<!--break-->

Other colleagues were inspired to meet together and have some fun for the first time working for a new employer.
Indeed, it was mostly old faces from a previous company he worked for the last decade, the company that is going to ashes right now. He thought –
*"Fascinating! Fate has given you a chance to change SOMETHING in your meaningless life, but you decided to follow the flow and ended up working with the same people and in the same domain"*.

This was a big event, and even not all guests actually had joined new company. One colleague wasn't invited, though.
Yesterday *J.* became aware of the event from her *'spying network'*, was frustrated to be out of the list and chatted with him looking for a reason.
Although it looked obvious to him, that time he didn't try to find a real answer for her.

*J.* was a modest little girl grown into a gorgeous and intelligent woman, surprising him day after day within their durable and fruitful teamwork.
Her new contract stuck in the corporate bureaucratic nightmare, and she was frightened to be left jobless in her sudden condition.
He desperately wanted to help her but didn't have any levers for this...

Suddenly, a scheduler reminder interrupted his thoughts.
He was still in no mood for seeing old-new colleagues, nor for any dinner, having lost appetite since that hellish summer of changes.
But he skipped too many such events within the last few years and decided to push himself forward.
The weather was something in-between seasons these days, so that heavy black coat felt a little bit too warm on him, but he wore it up, took a British cap and off to go.

The event was actually split in two pieces – one was for building team's spirit at bowling, and another one for pleasuring stomachs at a restaurant.
He decided in advance to cut off the first half and now headed directly to the second part.
Somewhere in the middle of a path, Patty's number appeared on his phone:

*– We are heading to the restaurant. Are you coming?*

*– Yes, I'm close.*

Martha was a new face in his life. She stole his attention from the very first working day at new job, the day after his birthday, when she met him with a charming smile and sparkling eyes.
He remembered her colorful dressings that day, how it looked a little weird to him, but somehow suited her well, complementing her vivid style.
Unable to resist her charms, he approached Patty a week after, but she replied with *"I'm in for a friendly chat!"*.
He knew that this breathtaking feeling in her presence, a stupid smile on his face and irresistible eyes' contact
would rapidly transform into much stronger affection and love, if he would dare knowing her better.
But it makes no sense making a friendship like this, so he gave up on her that time...

The restaurant was standing behind a small park at the city center. It was a notable restaurant in a Mexican style with Mexican cuisine.
He was there once for a business lunch, but saw the place for the first time on a weekend night.
The restaurant was crowded by resting visitors, the light was dimmed, loud music and merry chatting produced a lot of noise.
Team was already there – sitting at large tables connected in a horseshoe figure.

Seeing his arrival, Patty greeted him in black clothing and said about a couple of free chairs – the place at her left hand was still empty.
Her beautiful, curled hair was teasingly colored from dark roots to light ends, as a burning fire.
The thought flashed in his head – *"Such a pleasant surprise! A boring dinner is due to become a wonderful night"*.

Patty managed similar events for several teams in a row this week, thanks to the recently confirmed budget, and was pretty tired.
But she was full of life and supported a vivid dialog with him. She told a little bit about her study and suddenly thrown:

*– I'm ambivert! I'm shy in a big crowd of strangers... but feel comfortable within a good company!*

He thought – *"Why would she say that? She wants to tell me she feels comfortable with me? Or she throws this thing away to everybody?"*.
Was he an ambivert like Patty or an introvert, or *whateververt* himself? His grandma liked to say –
*"You were a perfect calm boy! Always just sitting around and keeping quiet, unlike your restless sister, who tore everything around her!"*.
Deliberately speaking most of the time, everybody saw his calm face and concluded he was at peace with his mind.
They just cannot see implosions and invisible scars left on his soul throughout his life...

*– Have you tried this dish, Patty?*

*– Does it have meat in it?*

*– Why? You don't eat beef?*

*– Not at all! I don't like its taste.*

*– That's an interesting description...*

He asked about fish, seafood and plenty of other stupid questions.
Colleagues were sitting around, but he barely noticed them, completely focused on Patty.
From time-to-time personnel put a large funny sombrero onto some guests in the outer space, played *"Cucaracha"* accords and shouted *"Señores y señoritas, our hermano has been just born!"*
occasionally putting *'brother'*, *'sister'*, *'child'*, *'company'* in place.
Sounded funny the first time, it became annoying after many repetitions. He was wondering, was this show entertaining or burdening to personnel itself?

*– You know, my ex has married my best friend, and now I'm embarrassed to visit her!*

Continued Patty. He thought *"You don't need an ex marrying your best friend to lose a friend – a simple marriage could be enough"*.
His two closest friends from high school years stopped hanging out with him soon after they became husbands –
*"Sorry dude, have no time"*, *"Sorry, I'm buried by work"*, *"Sorry, driving my son to a contest this weekend"*...
His sister disliked *E.* in school days, but they became best friends after starting to raise their own children.
Married couples are like a closed society that doesn't like strangers in it.
Or maybe it has nothing to do with marriage – maybe it is just himself, having no idea how to make a good friendship.

He eagerly listened to Patty stories and wanted to know more and more about her, watching her lovely mimics and smooth gestures.
Suddenly, a costume show visited the team. The big boss made a toast of inspiration followed by applause and left the event soon afterwards.
It was an indication that the night is close to an end.

Colleagues left the restaurant, but Patty was still there, withheld to help with receipts.
He didn't want to leave Patty like this without suggesting her company to the subway station or at least to the door of a taxicab.
But awaiting took too much time...

Being unsure if she would be glad or annoyed seeing him waiting her like a stalker, he headed towards the home.
It was already dark, the sky poured a thin rain on his head, but he didn't care and walked through the main street enjoying the night.
He thought – *"What was that about? Why does it feel like a date?"*.

Later on, he concluded – *"That's because you haven't been on a real date with kisses and touches for ages"*.
Just hold his hand tight, and it will already be a perfect date to him with no kisses.
The only taste of the past persisted in his treacherous mind was a weird kiss of lips after marinated mushrooms.
Anyway, it's not the taste that is most important when kissing your loved one, it is how she responds to you.

He passed by an opened café, where he took an ice cream. In cold times he liked teasing himself with a *"probably the last open-air ice cream of the season"*,
and greedily licked dessert under pouring rain, holding it in freezing hands.

Pleasant memories about beautiful Patty kept floating in his inflamed mind.
She felt so pure to him, alive, adorable, amusing, that he could barely believe he didn't imagine this fallen angel.
*"Don't fool yourself! This smile is not for you, not because of you! She doesn't feel anything to you!"* – tried to resist his mind.
But his loudly pounding heart didn't want to listen to any reasoning.
*"Just look in my eyes... Hold it! Can you see my feelings for you there? Can you see the reflection of the universe in them? If only eyes could talk..."*.

With such thoughts he arrived home and soon fell asleep.
He didn't know it yet, but in some months, his brain will fail in resistance and let Patty to entirely occupy his mind.
The lights of the city were swallowed by the darkness with stars still hidden by clouds.
