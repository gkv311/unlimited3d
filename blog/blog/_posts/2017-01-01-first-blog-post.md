Hi, I'm Kirill Gavrilov, software developer and manager currently employed by Open CASCADE (Datavision NN, Nizhny Novgorod).

I've decided to start a personal blog, because as many others – I would like to share my personal ideas and experience with others.

3D is an important part of my life – from hobby projects to everyday job.
I've created and still working on an open-source project [sView](https://www.sview.ru) since '2007.
sView is a stereoscopic media player and image viewer for 3d stereo and VR.
So the main focus of this blog will be on 3D – hence it was named "Unlimited 3D".
Anyway, don't blame me for posing notes not related to this subject directly ;).

I'm also participating in development of [Open CASCADE Technology](https://dev.opencascade.org/) since '2009 – both as part of my regular job in Open CASCADE, as well as personal contributions prepared in a spare time.
My expertise is focused on 3D here – evolution of 3D Viewer based on OpenGL / OpenGL ES technology.

Since '2014, I'm also a one of developers of great freeware 3D Viewer for CAD models – Open CASCADE [CAD Assistant](https://dev.opencascade.org/project/cad-assistant) available for free on Windows, OS X, Android and iOS platforms.
